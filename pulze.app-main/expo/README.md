# Welcome to your Rork app

## Project info

This is a native cross-platform mobile app created with [Rork](https://rork.com)

**Platform**: Native iOS & Android app, exportable to web
**Framework**: Expo Router + React Native

## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your native mobile application.

### **Use Rork**

Simply visit [rork.com](https://rork.com) and prompt to build your app with AI.

Changes made via Rork will be committed automatically to this GitHub repo.

Whenever you make a change in your local code editor and push it to GitHub, it will be also reflected in Rork.

### **Use your preferred code editor**

If you want to work locally using your own code editor, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Rork.

If you are new to coding and unsure which editor to use, we recommend Cursor. If you're familiar with terminals, try Claude Code.

The only requirement is having Node.js & Bun installed - [install Node.js with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) and [install Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)

Follow these steps:

```bash
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
bun i

# Step 4: Start the instant web preview of your Rork app in your browser, with auto-reloading of your changes
bun run start-web

# Step 5: Start iOS preview
# Option A (recommended):
bun run start  # then press "i" in the terminal to open iOS Simulator
# Option B (if supported by your environment):
bun run start -- --ios
```

### **Local setup for map directions**

This app now supports **in-app live walking directions** on the map screen using the **Google Routes API**.

Before starting the app locally:

1. Enable **Billing** in your Google Cloud project
2. Enable the **Routes API**
3. Create a local env file in `expo/.env`
4. Add your key:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your_google_routes_api_key_here
```

Notes:

- `expo/.env` is ignored by git and should stay local
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_...` keys are fine for local dev, but they are **not secret**
- For production, move Google Routes requests behind a backend/proxy

### **Local setup for Eventbrite ticketing POC**

This app now supports a **single-event Eventbrite POC** for the ticketing flow.

Before starting the app locally:

1. Create or update `expo/.env`
2. Add your Eventbrite token and a concrete Eventbrite event ID:

```bash
EXPO_PUBLIC_EVENTBRITE_API_KEY=your_eventbrite_private_token_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_EVENTBRITE_EVENT_ID=20955468370
```

Notes:

- the current POC fetches **one specific Eventbrite event by ID** and maps it into the existing Pulze ticket UI
- checkout is a **hosted Eventbrite handoff**, not a native in-app card form
- public Eventbrite search and owned-events discovery were not reliable for this account, so direct event-by-ID fetch is the safest POC path here
- you can usually find the event ID in an Eventbrite URL slug ending like `-tickets-123456789`
- `EXPO_PUBLIC_...` values are exposed to the client in Expo, so this is okay for local/dev POCs but **not** a production-secret approach
- for production, move Eventbrite requests behind your own backend/proxy

### **Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with the most popular native mobile cross-platform technical stack:

- **React Native** - Cross-platform native mobile development framework created by Meta and used for Instagram, Airbnb, and lots of top apps in the App Store
- **Expo** - Extension of React Native + platform used by Discord, Shopify, Coinbase, Telsa, Starlink, Eightsleep, and more
- **Expo Router** - File-based routing system for React Native with support for web, server functions and SSR
- **TypeScript** - Type-safe JavaScript
- **React Query** - Server state management
- **Lucide React Native** - Beautiful icons

## How can I test my app?

### **On your phone (Recommended)**

1. **iOS**: Download the [Rork app from the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/app/rork) or [Expo Go](https://apps.apple.com/app/expo-go/id982107779)
2. **Android**: Download the [Expo Go app from Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=host.exp.exponent)
3. Run `bun run start` and scan the QR code from your development server
4. On iPhone, open the Camera app and scan the Expo QR code, then choose **Expo Go** if prompted

### **In your browser**

Run `bun start-web` to test in a web browser. Note: The browser preview is great for quick testing, but some native features may not be available.

### **iOS Simulator / Android Emulator**

You can test Rork apps in Expo Go or Rork iOS app. You don't need XCode or Android Studio for most features.

#### **Android Emulator on Windows**

1. Open **Android Studio**
2. Go to **More Actions** → **Virtual Device Manager** (or **Device Manager**)
3. Create a new virtual device, for example:
   - Device: **Pixel 7**
   - System image: latest stable **Android 14/15** image available
4. Start the emulator and wait until Android fully boots
5. In the `expo` folder, install dependencies if needed:

```bash
bun i
```

6. Start the Expo dev server:

```bash
bun run start
```

7. In the Expo terminal, press:
   - `a` to open the app in the Android emulator
   - or scan the QR code from a physical phone

If the emulator is already running and detected, Expo should install/open the app automatically.

#### **iPhone QR testing from Windows**

Because iOS Simulator only runs on macOS, the Windows workflow is:

1. Install **Expo Go** on your iPhone
2. Run `bun run start`
3. Make sure the dev server shows a **QR code**
4. Scan it with your iPhone camera
5. Open the link in **Expo Go**

This project already uses tunnel mode in the start script, which helps device testing work more reliably.

**When do you need Custom Development Builds?**

- Native authentication (Face ID, Touch ID, Apple Sign In)
- In-app purchases and subscriptions
- Push notifications
- Custom native modules

## App Features

This template includes:

- **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on iOS, Android, and Web
- **File-based routing** with Expo Router
- **Tab navigation** with customizable tabs
- **Modal screens** for overlays and dialogs
- **Live map screen** with native maps and user location
- **In-app walking directions** powered by Google Routes API
- **TypeScript support** for better development experience
- **Async storage** for local data persistence
- **Vector icons** with Lucide React Native

## Live walking directions implementation

The map screen at `app/(tabs)/map.tsx` now supports:

- fetching a **walking route** from the user's live location to the selected venue
- drawing the route **inside the app**
- showing an ETA and distance banner
- refreshing the route as the user moves

Implementation details:

- Google route fetch logic lives in `services/googleRoutes.ts`
- The app expects `EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` in `expo/.env`
- iPhone can use Google route data while still rendering the base map with Apple MapKit
- Android uses the Google map provider through `react-native-maps`
